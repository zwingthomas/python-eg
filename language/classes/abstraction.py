""" 
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own;
meant to be subclasses. They can contain abstract methods, which are 
declares but have no implementation. 

The benefits of these are:
1. Prevents instantiation of the class itself
2. Requires children to use inherited abstract methods
