"""
What and why: Design Patterns?

- Ways of solving similar problems in similar ways.
- You will often run into the same kind of issues in many languages and 
    this gives you a standard way to implement solutions
- Gives you the certainty that your solution solves the problem
- Also gives you scalability, extensibility, and testability as "Nice
    to haves".
- Introduces seperation of concerns: seperating your code into blocks
    of components that solve problems in isolation and allow for better
    architecture.
- Also gives you standard terminology to share with your fellow
    engineers.
- They introduce best practices. There is often one right way to solve
    a particular problem and many wrong ways - although those will 
    still work.
- These were created by the Gang of Four: a group of software 
    architects that put together the original book on design patterns.
    They created these solutions to common problems and called them
    design patterns.

3 types

1. Creational
- Relate to how you create different objects or components in your
    application. 
- A way of achieving different designs with a bunch of "Nice to haves"
    for your component.

2. Structural
- We take a closer view of the component and see how that component is
    structured to achieve those "Nice to haves" like testability and
    scalability.

3. Behavioral
- We see how components we've created interact and communicate with
    one another.
